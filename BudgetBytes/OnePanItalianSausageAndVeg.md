### One Pan Italian Sausage And Veg:  ###

Servings:

- 4

Main ingredients:

- 2 large carrots
- 2 small red potatoes
- 1 zucchini
- 2 red peppers
- 1 head broccoli
- 370g Italian sausage

For seasonings:

- 1/2 tablespoon EACH: dried basil, dried oregano, dried parsley, garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon EACH: onion powder, dried thyme
- 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes optional
- Fine sea salt & freshly cracked pepper
- 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese freshly grated
- 4 and 1/2 tablespoons (59g) olive oil
- Optional: fresh parsley
- Optional: serve over cooked quinoa/rice/cauliflower rice

Instructions :

1. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C. Line a very large pan (or use 2 smaller sheet pans) with parchment paper or foil and set aside.
2. It is important to prep the veggies according to directions to ensure they all cook at the same rate. Peel and thinly slice the carrots (1/8th inch thick). Wash and chop the red potatoes (leave the peel on). You want the pieces quite small here. (I halve the potatoes and then dice each half. This yields a total of 10-12 pieces per potato)

3. Halve the zucchini lengthwise and then cut thick half-moons about 1/2 inch thick. Coarsely chop the broccoli into florets. Remove the stems and seeds from the peppers and chop into 1-inch pieces. Chop the sausage into thick (1/2-inch) coins.
4. Place all the veggies and sausage on the prepared sheet pan. Drizzle the olive oil over everything. Add the seasonings right on top: the basil, oregano, parsley, garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, and optional red pepper flakes. Season to taste with salt and pepper (I use about 1/8 teaspoon pepper and 1/2 teaspoon salt). With your hands, toss to coat all the veggies and sausage in the seasoning/oil mixture. Once well coated, quickly space the veggies/sausage so none are overlapping and everything has plenty of space to roast. If everything is overlapping, cook time will be longer and veggies will steam not roast.
5. Place sheet pan in the oven and roast for 15 minutes. Remove and toss/flip the veggies and sausage. Return to the oven for another 10-20 minutes or until veggies are crisp-tender.
6. Remove pan from the oven and top, if desired, with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and fresh chopped parsley.
7. Serve as is out of the oven or on top of rice, quinoa, or cooked cauliflower rice.
