Garlic herb baked chicken breast or garlic herb chickpeas ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts OR two 425g cans chickpeas
- 2 Tbsp butter, room temperature
- 1 tsp dried parsley
- 1/2 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp dried basil
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp onion powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- pepper

Instructions
1. Roasted vegetable couscous
    - Prepare the Roasted Vegetable Couscous first. Preheat the oven to 200ºC. Chop the Roma tomatoes, zucchini, and bell pepper into 1-inch pieces. Slice the red onion into 10mm thick strips. Place the tomatoes, zucchini, bell pepper, onion, and peeled garlic on a large baking sheet.
    - Drizzle the olive oil over the chopped vegetables, toss to coat, then season with a couple pinches of salt and pepper. Roast the vegetables for about 45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes or so.
    - While the vegetables are roasting, begin the couscous. Bring the vegetable broth to a boil in a small sauce pot. Once boiling, stir in the couscous. Place a lid on top, remove the pot from the heat, and let the couscous sit for five minutes, or until all of the broth is absorbed. Fluff the couscous with a fork, then place in the refrigerator to begin cooling as you prepare the rest of the meal.
2. For garlic herb baked chicken
    - While the couscous is chilling, begin the garlic herb baked chicken. Combine the room temperature butter with the parsley, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Stir until it forms a paste.
    - If the chicken breasts are thick, gently pound them with a mallet or rolling pin until they are an even thickness, no more than 20mm thick (I cover the chicken with plastic to prevent splatter when pounding). Pat the chicken dry, then smear the butter herb mixture over the entire surface.
    - Place the seasoned chicken in a baking dish and bake for 20 minutes at 200ºC, or until the internal temperature reaches 165ºF. Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes, then slice into strips.
3. FOR GARLIC HERB CHICKPEAS
    - To make Garlic Herb Chickpeas instead, rinse and drain 2 425g cans of chickpeas. Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium. Once hot, add the chickpeas, and sauté for about 5 minutes, or until the chickpeas are golden and the skins are blistered. Remove them from heat and then season with the same garlic herb spices used for the chicken (no butter). Stir until the chickpeas are coated in the herbs and spices.
