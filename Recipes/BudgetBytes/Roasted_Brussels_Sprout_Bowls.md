- 0.5 Tbsp(9ml) red wine vinegar

- Freshly cracked pepper

for roasted brussels sprouts and sausage:

- 200g fresh Brussels sprouts (Frozen are also good but not as roasted)
- 170g Italian sausage
- 1 Tbsp(9ml) olive oil

Instructions :

- Peel and cube the potatoes into 1-inch pieces. Rinse them well in a colander, then transfer to a pot and add 1/2 tsp salt and enough water to cover. Place a lid on the pot and heat over high until the water begins to boil. Boil the potatoes until very tender (about 7-10 minutes). Drain the potatoes in the colander and rinse briefly with hot water again to remove excess starch.
- While the potatoes are draining, return the pot to the stove and add the butter and milk. Heat over low until the butter has melted and the milk is hot. Return the cooked potatoes to the pot, turn the heat off, and mash until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
- Meanwhile, make the Creamy Dijon Dressing. Combine all the ingredients (olive oil, Dijon, mayonnaise, red wine vinegar, salt, pepper, sugar, garlic powder) in a small bowl or jar and whisk until combined. Set the dressing aside.
- Preheat the oven to 425ÂºF. Remove any wilted or damaged leaves from the Brussels sprouts and slice them in half. Slice the sausage into 1/2-inch wide medallions.
- Add both the Brussels sprouts and sausage to a large baking dish and drizzle 2 Tbsp olive oil over top. Toss the Brussels sprouts and sausage in the oil until everything is well coated and the baking sheet has a good layer of oil on its surface as well. Roast the Brussels sprouts and sausage in the hot oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are well browned, stirring once half way through. Season with a pinch of salt after cooking.
- To build the bowls, add about 1 cup of mashed potatoes to each bowl, then add 1/4 of the roasted Brussels sprouts and sausage to each bowl. Drizzle a couple spoonfuls of the creamy Dijon dressing over top just before serving.
