Ingrediets:
- 12 mini tortillas
- 1/2 onion
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 small green bell pepper
- 1 small orange bell pepper
- 400g extra firm pressed tofu / 400g chicken thighs
- 1/2 cup fire roasted tomatoes (or tomato sauce)
- 3 tbsp taco seasoning
- Handful of cilantro (coriander)
- Juice of 1 lime

Avocado dip ingredients:

- Handful cilantro
- 1/4 cup hemp seeds
- Juice of 1-2 limes
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 tsp maple syrup
- 3-4 tbsp water
- 1 jalapeño, deseeded (Optional)

Instructions for shredded chicken thighs:
- You’ll start by drizzling a little olive oil into a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the chicken and sprinkle salt and pepper generously on the top side. Let this cook for 5 minutes (it should be slightly golden), then use tongs to flip the chicken over.
- Once the chicken is flipped over, add 3/4 cup of chicken broth to the pan and cover with a lid. This will keep the chicken moist while cooking it fast. Cook the chicken for another 10-14 minutes. Or use thermometer to ensure the chicken is cooked through (75ºC).
- Once finished shred with 2 forks / Stand mixer / Hand mixer

Instructions:
- Sauté your onion until translucent then add in your garlic & bell peppers.
- Shred your tofu/chicken & add it into your veggies along with some taco seasoning & fire roasted tomatoes.
- Make a cashew cream by blending together your cashews & water. If you do not have a high speed blender make sure to soak your cashews first!
- Mix in your cashew cream & add in some chopped cilantro & fresh lime juice.
- Add the filling to mini tortillas and roll them up nice and tight!
- Add your taquitos to a greased baking dish, brush with some olive oil and bake at 200ºC for 25-30 minutes until golden.
- Serve with avocado dip
