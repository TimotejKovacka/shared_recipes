### Ombre Apple Tart ###
Price: 5
Difficulty: 6
Servings: 12

Dough:

- 150-180g plain flour
- 60-70g powder sugar
- 130g butter
- pinch of salt
- 1-2 eggs (depends on size of eggs)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 28cm pie pan

Filling:

- 8-10 apples, we choose them based on colour aiming to create a colour spectrum from red to green (red, pink, orange, yellow, green)
- 1 tbsp ground cinnamon
- 50-60g caster sugar
- pinch of salt

Instructions:

- Start by mixing flour, sugar, salt after ingredients are thorougly mixed add the rest. We want to achieve nice crumbled dough which after pressing stays together.
- We roll the dough into a ball cover with foil and let it rest in fridge for at least 2 hours.
- In the meantime we will prepare our apples. We deseed them and halve them, next we slice them in 2mm pieces so they create a nice texture in the tart later on.
- After letting the dough rest we butter the sides of pan so that the dough does not stick. We roll the rested dough into the form of the pan and and put it in it.
- We now let the dough rest for 10minutes in the pan inside a fridge so it gets used to the form. In the meantime we prepare an egg wash that we will be using to cover the sides of the dough so it gets nice and golden after baking.
- Preheat the oven to 200°C, brush the sides of the dough with prepared egg wash and let it bake for 5minutes
- Lets prepare our frosting for apples. We will mix sugar, cinnamon and salt with a fork and we are ready to put it all together.
- After our dough has finished baking we follow by putting our prepared apple pieces as in the picture and try to follow our colour spectrum.
- Cover apple pieces by our frosting mixture, once again cover sides with egg wash and bake at 180°C for 25-30 minutes until apples are nice and golden and our sugar has caramelized
- Let the tart rest for few minutes and serve with ice-cream
