Prep: 10
Cook: 15

Ingredients:

- 2 servings dry instant ramen noodle cakes or other noodles of choice (around 140 g total)
- 10 oz extra firm tofu, veggies, or mushrooms of choice sliced
- 1 cup water or vegetable broth (see notes)
- 5-7 tbsp soy sauce adjust according to desired taste
- 1.5 tsp dark soy sauce , optional for colour
- 2-3 tbsp corn starch , see notes
- 1-3 tbsp sugar , maple syrup, or other liquid sweetener, adjust according to desired sweetness
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar , white vinegar, or lemon juice, adjust according to desired sourness
- 1/4 tsp ground pepper
- 1/2 tbsp chili garlic sauce or other hot sauce, optional for spice (see homemade chili garlic sauce recipe here)
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 2 cloves garlic minced (optional)
- Chopped scallions for topping
- Sesame seeds for topping

Instructions :
1. Mix all the sauce ingredients until well incorporated. Feel free to adjust the sauce ingredient measurements depending on your desired sweetness, saltiness, sourness, and spice. Afterwards, set aside. (Note: you may have a sauce that's more on the red side in terms of colour if using hot sauce.)
Also, if you plan to use way more veggies and more noodles, you can double the sauce recipe to make sure your noodles still turn out saucy!

2. Boil some water in a small pot over high heat. Once it boils, add in the ramen or other noodles of choice.

3. Half cook the noodles until still very chewy or have that good bite in the middle. You can cook it 2-3 minutes less than the package instructions, This way it won't overcook in the sauce later on.

4. Drain out the water or strain the noodles then set aside. You can also opt to run them through cold water to stop the noodles from cooking down further and also remove excess starch.

5. While the noodles are cooking, heat a pan over medium high. Add a little oil.

6. Saut√© the veggies, mushrooms, or tofu for a few minutes until cooked to your liking.

7. Afterwards, give the sauce a good mix again. Make sure none of the starch is stuck at the bottom. Pour in the sauce into the pan. Leave the sauce to simmer for 2-3 minutes over medium heat or until the sauce starts to thicken from the starch. Continuously mix the sauce to prevent it from sticking to the pan.

8. When the sauce has slightly thickened, add in the noodles to the pan.

9. Mix the noodles well to coat in the sauce.

10. Cook the noodles over medium high heat until the noodles absorb some of the sauce and the sauce is thick, around 3 minutes.

11. Taste the noodles and feel free to season with some more soy sauce, sweetener, soy sauce, and pepper if needed.

12. Garnish with sesame seeds and spring onions, if desired. Enjoy immediately while hot!
