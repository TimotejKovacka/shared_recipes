  ### 3 ingredient naan bread:  ### 
  1 3/4 cups self-rising flour use gluten-free, if needed
  1 cup Greek Yogurt vegan Greek yogurt, non-fat, full-fat or reduced fat
  1/2 teaspoon salt
  1 tablespoon butter of choice Optional, to brush naan breads
  
  - Instructions :
  In a large mixing bowl, combine your flour, salt (if using it) and Greek yogurt. Mix well, until combined. Then, use your hands to form a large ball of dough.
  Lightly flour a wooden or kitchen surface. Sprinkle a little extra flour on top of the ball of dough, before transferring it to the floured surface. Flatten into a circular shape and divide into 8 even portions. Flatten each portion into a rectangular shape (like a classic Naan bread).
  Heat a non-stick saucepan on medium heat. When hot, place flattened dough and cook for 3 minutes, before flipping and cooking a further 2 minutes. Repeat until all the naan bread is cooked. Once cooked, if desired, lightly brush the tops of each naan bread with melted butter.
